    <h3>Reasons For Joining AltSchool</h3>
    I am a mobile apps developer, with like 4 years of experience. 
    I'm joining the cloud engineering track of AltSchool because I want to add to my skill set and open up opportunities for my self.
    <p>Also, even as a mobile app developer, I've had reason to provision serviers and setup backends, so I want to have a formal training on it, so that if 
        I need to use the knowledge while working as an apps developer, I'll make decisions from a more informed standpoint, and if I need to work fully in a 
        cloud engineering setup, all the better, I'll be ready for it.
